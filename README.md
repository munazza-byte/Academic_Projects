OBJECTIVE:
Design and implement a console-based Gaming World application featuring interactive mini-games to reinforce programming fundamentals.
DESCRIPTION:
Developed a C++ console application titled "Gaming World" that integrates two mini-games: Betting Game and Hangman Game.
The Betting Game allows players to bet on numbers and win or lose virtual currency, with a time constraint and score tracking.
The Hangman Game involves guessing exotic fruit names within a limited number of tries and time.
Implemented user input handling, game loops, and time constraints using the <chrono> library.
Ensured replayability and modular game flow through structured menu systems and logic branching.
TECHNOLOGIES USED: C++, chrono, srand, time, basic input/output, control structures
OUTCOME:
Successfully built a time-bound, interactive gaming experience that demonstrates strong command over fundamental C++ programming constructs, including loops, conditionals, and modular design.
