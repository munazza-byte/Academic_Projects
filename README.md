### PF PROJECT: Gaming World – Mini-Games in C++

#### Objective  
Design and implement a console-based Gaming World application featuring interactive mini-games to reinforce programming fundamentals.

#### Description  
- Developed a C++ console application titled "Gaming World" with two integrated games:
  - Betting Game – A number-guessing game with balance tracking, score updates, and a 120-second time limit.
  - Hangman Game – A word-guessing game using exotic fruit names, allowing 7 incorrect guesses within a time constraint.
- Implemented structured menus and loops for replayability and smooth game flow.
- Used `<chrono>` for timing logic and `srand` for randomization.
- Focused on basic input/output, conditionals, loops, and modular logic.

#### Technologies Used  
C++, chrono, srand, time.h, standard I/O operations, control structures

#### Outcome  
Built an interactive, time-bound game application that demonstrates core programming skills in C++, including control flow, timers, user input, and game logic.
