### PF PROJECT: Gaming World – Mini-Games in C++

#### Objective  
Design and implement a console-based Gaming World application featuring interactive mini-games to reinforce programming fundamentals.

#### Description  
- Developed a C++ console application titled "Gaming World" with two integrated games:
  - Betting Game – A number-guessing game with balance tracking, score updates, and a 120-second time limit.
  - Hangman Game – A word-guessing game using exotic fruit names, allowing 7 incorrect guesses within a time constraint.
- Implemented structured menus and loops for replayability and smooth game flow.
- Used `<chrono>` for timing logic and `srand` for randomization.
- Focused on basic input/output, conditionals, loops, and modular logic.

#### Technologies Used  
C++, chrono, srand, time.h, standard I/O operations, control structures

#### Outcome  
Built an interactive, time-bound game application that demonstrates core programming skills in C++, including control flow, timers, user input, and game logic.


### Event Management System – OOP-based Console Application

#### Objective  
Design and implement a console-based Event Management System using object-oriented programming principles in C++.

#### Description  
- Built an event management system that handles data for **workshops** and **exhibitions**.
- Applied core OOP concepts: **inheritance**, **polymorphism**, **operator overloading**, **exception handling**, and **file I/O**.
- Implemented a menu-driven interface for managing events, including:
  - Displaying all or specific events
  - Identifying popular, cheapest, and largest events
  - Finding events on the same date
  - Updating event information
  - Writing event data to `Output.txt`
  - Displaying revenue statistics (total, per event type, highest/lowest earning events)
- Used virtual functions to allow polymorphic behavior between event types.
- Utilized operator overloading (`==`) to compare events based on date.
- Performed input validation using custom exception handling.
- Read and wrote event data using file streams from/to `Event.txt` and `Output.txt`.

#### Technologies Used  
C++, Object-Oriented Programming (OOP), File Handling, Exception Handling, Virtual Functions, Operator Overloading

#### Outcome  
Successfully developed a feature-rich, extensible system that demonstrates advanced proficiency in OOP, allowing for flexible event data management and analysis through a structured console interface.
